Introduction
First of all , using Api in java is easy and has little
steps and diffrint Results and this Documantion will make
the process easy.

*What is API :
API is A documents wich give us A list of package ,classes with the fields and methods.
API make the programmer to know how to use package, classes, and methods in java library.


*How to use : 
The first step , browse API URL in browser and show list of diffrent classes . 
check if the classes in a list or not . try to convert that results into pseudocode to 
understand where the classes and their fields . then useing java softwere like Eclips to use this API.

* inside eclips we will convert JSON API into classes :
public class ApiResults {

     String gender; ** property **
	 String email;  ** property **
	 String phone;  ** property **
	** Object Chining **
	** Create Object from classes **
	
	 Picture picture;
	 Registerd registerd;
	 Name name;

1)Featch the API URL to connet it and start use it :
URL url =  new URL("https://randomuser.me/api/?results=30");

2)To retrieve information from the URL using HttpURLConnection :
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

3)to Request the URLconnection to GET information from it :
conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
conn.connect();

4) To retrieve all information in String data Type:
StringBuilder informationString = new StringBuilder();

5) URLconnection is ready now and all information inside informationString object , to check use :
System.out.println(informationString);
** all list from API will be display **

6) Download all Libraries will need as JSON jar library :
gson-2.6.2;

7)Then creat Gson Object an use it in the class wiche use the classes wit getter and sitters :
Gson gson = new Gson();						
RandomUserAPI result= gson.fromJson(informationString.toString(), RandomUserAPI.class);
public class RandomUserAPI {

	private ApiInfo info;
	private List<ApiResults> results;

	public ApiInfo getInfo() {
		return info;
	}

	public void setInfo(ApiInfo info) {
		this.info = info;
	}

	public List<ApiResults> getResults() {
		return results;
	}

	public void setResults(List<ApiResults> results) {
		this.results = results;
	}

}

8)Last Step using System.out.println to get values from API and Display it using Object Chining :
	System.out.println("|"+"The Name Is : "+result.getResults().get(k).getName().getFirstName()+" "
							+result.getResults().get(k).getName().getLastName());


9)On Thursday I added Nationality,Gender,Include,Exclude  :
 System.out.println to get values from API and Display it using Object Chining :
	Ask user to enter Nationality:
	the output will show information by the Nationality chosen by the user only
	System.out.println("|"+"Nationality Is : "+result.getResults().get(0).getNat());

	Ask user to enter Gender:
	the output will show information by the Gender chosen by the user only	
	To Specify Gender 
	System.out.println("|"+"Gender Is : "+result.getResults().get(0).getGender());

	Ask user to enter the fields want to Includes in the output:
	the output will show information that was chosen to Include by user only
	Enter fields you want to Include
	System.out.println("|"+"Includes fields are  : "+ inc1);

	
	Ask user to enter the fields want to Exclude in the output:
	the output will show information that was chosen to Exclude by user only
	Enter fields you want to Exclude
	System.out.println("|"+"Includes fields are  : "+ exc1);
